# AI-Enterprise-Final

Our project is designed to implement, and long-form work or concept in the area of artificial intelligence. Our team has taken the dataset from Kaggle â€“ Link to Dataset. The dataset consists of seven geometric parameters of wheat kernels and their associated varieties. The objective of our group is applying the learning algorithms that was introduced in the course to be implemented on a far more practical level dataset, and to determine the results that has obtained from different visualization that has been made because of those algorithms to clearly identify our learnings throughout the course. On a dataset of wheat seeds with seven attributes for three different kinds of wheat kernels, we will apply EDA: (Kama, Rosa, Canadian). Because it enables us to more clearly see the fundamental patterns, structures, and relationships in our data set.

After the implementation of algorithm in the dataset we should be able to include all the determining factors as the datasets have total 7 variables to measure and will be able to identify and differentiate though them
